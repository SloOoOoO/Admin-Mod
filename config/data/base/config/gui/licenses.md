    "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions
    granted by this License.

    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but
    not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
    translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code,
    generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
    available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or
    attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is
    based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
    annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original
    work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not
    include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the
    interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of
    the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof,
    that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright

    copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of
    electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its
    representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
    lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or
    on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in
    writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom
    a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the
    Work.

    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
    each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
    no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
    Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute
    the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
    Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
    royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,
    have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
    such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that
    are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
    Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or
    counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated
    within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
    patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of
    the date such litigation is filed.

    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative
    Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object
    form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this
    License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
    changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
    all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the
    Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works;
    and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any
    Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution
    notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain
    to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a
    NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form
    or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display
    generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally
    appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not
    modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works
    that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
    provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the
    License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
    additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
    distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
    provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
    Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor
    shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms
    or conditions.  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor
    regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
    trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
    reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the
    content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,
    Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS
    IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
    including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
    NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
    responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work
    and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort
    (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law
    (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any
    Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
    License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
    damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
    and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised
    of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
    Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of
    support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent
    with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your
    own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
    and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
    liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
    accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

PIX EVENT RUNTIME FOR WINDOWS

IF YOU LIVE IN (OR ARE A BUSINESS WITH A PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS IN) THE UNITED STATES, PLEASE READ THE "BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER" SECTION BELOW. IT AFFECTS HOW DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED.

These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above and any Microsoft services or software updates (except to the extent such services or updates are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft’s rights relating to pre-updated software or services). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.

1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
  a. General. You may install and use any number of copies of the software to design, develop and test your Microsoft Windows programs.
  b. Third Party Software. The software may include third party applications that are licensed to you under this agreement or under their own terms. License terms, notices, and acknowledgements, if any, for the third party applications may be accessible online at http://aka.ms/thirdpartynotices or in an accompanying notices file. Even if such applications are governed by other agreements, the disclaimer, limitations on, and exclusions of damages below also apply to the extent allowed by applicable law.

2. DISTRIBUTABLE CODE.
  a. Distributable Code. The software is comprised of Distributable Code. "Distributable Code" is code that you are permitted to distribute in programs you develop if you comply with the terms below.
    (i) Right to Use and Distribute.
      * You may copy and distribute the object code form of the software.
      * Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your programs to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those programs.
    (ii) Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, you must
      * add significant primary functionality to it in your programs;
      * require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it at least as much as this agreement;
      * display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and
      * indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of your programs.
    (iii) Distribution Restrictions. You may not
      * alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable Code;
      * use Microsoft’s trademarks in your programs’ names or in a way that suggests your programs come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;
      * distribute Distributable Code to run on a platform other than a Windows platform;
      * include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful programs; or
      * modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, that
        * the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or
        * others have the right to modify it.

3. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you will not (and have no right to):
  a. work around any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways;
  b. reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software;
  c. remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;
  d. use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or propagate malware; or
  e. share, publish, distribute, or lend the software, provide the software as a stand-alone hosted solution for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.

4. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit http://aka.ms/exporting.

5. SUPPORT SERVICES. Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to provide any support services for the software. Any support provided is "as is", "with all faults", and without warranty of any kind.

6. BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. This Section applies if you live in (or, if a business, your principal place of business is in) the United States. If you and Microsoft have a dispute, you and Microsoft agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. If you and Microsoft can’t, you and Microsoft agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity are not allowed; nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. The complete Arbitration Agreement contains more terms and is at http://aka.ms/arb-agreement-1. You and Microsoft agree to these terms.

7. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the software.

8. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles, except that the FAA governs everything related to arbitration. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply, except that the FAA governs everything related to arbitration. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court (excluding arbitration). If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court (excluding arbitration).

9. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state, province, or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state, province, or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:
  a. Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
  b. Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.
  c. Germany and Austria.
    (i) Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.
    (ii) Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.
    Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.

10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS IS." YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

11. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.


[Please note: As this software is distributed in Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.

Remarque: Ce logiciel étant distribué au Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.

EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel quel ». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril. Microsoft n’accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bénéficier de droits additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des consommateurs, que ce contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par le droit locale, les garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d’adéquation à un usage particulier et d’absence de contrefaçon sont exclues.

LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous ne pouvez prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y compris les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de bénéfices.

Cette limitation concerne:
  * tout ce qui est relié au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris le code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes tiers; et
  * les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou au titre de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre faute dans la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur.

Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard.

EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.]
